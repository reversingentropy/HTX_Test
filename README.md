# HTX xData Technical Test â€“ Data Scientist Submission

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **HTX xData Technical Test** for the **Data Scientist** role.  
The test consists of two main task groups:  

1. **Model Prediction Tasks**  
2. **Link Analysis Tasks**  

Each task group is implemented in a **separate Jupyter Notebook**, containing code, outputs, visualizations, and explanations tailored for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Task Summary

### Model Prediction Task I
- Built a predictive model to determine factors affecting **residential property prices in Singapore**.  
- Steps include:
  - Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
  - Model training with CPU-compatible algorithms  
  - Model evaluation using relevant metrics  
- Delivered insights on potential strategies to **manage housing price inflation**.

### Model Prediction Task II
- Discussed **considerations and factors** in developing an **in-house predictive model**.  

---

### Link Analysis Task I
- Constructed a **graph** representing relationships between property listings.  
- Documented and justified:
  - Graph schema design  
  - Feature construction choices  
- Provided a **high-level analysis** of graph components.

---

### Link Analysis Task II
- Applied **graph algorithms** including:
  - PageRank  
  - Community detection  
- Explained algorithmic choices and **interpreted results**.
